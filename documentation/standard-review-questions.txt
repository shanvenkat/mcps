A note of common sense: You don't litterally have to ask all of these every time.
Review them to see if asking will help you develop.

1 - What feature(s) does comp capture?
2 - Are these features parity or enhancements?
3 - If parity, is there a URL where I can use the legacy implementation?
4 - Are any of the functional elements already implemented in another repository
    - Example: The overlay was implemented as external-link-popup in the falcon theme repo
5 - Ensure form functionality is understood
    - Example: Do buttons click or toggle? Are selections multiple or single? Etc.
6 - From a data perspective, is there anything blocking cd3 preparation?
    - And timeline around actual implementation
